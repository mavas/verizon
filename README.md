# Candidate work for Verizon computer vision C++ job

This repository contains work just to help convince www.Verizon.com to hire me for a contract job they have open.

## Verizon job-specific writeup

### C++

It seems like this is heavily C++ oriented, and that's the first language I started with at the age of 15 in middle school.  Olimar's Escape is the (https://github.com/mavas/olimar-escape)[Olimar's escape] first significant project I worked on.  Of course it featured the obvious game loop that every game has, which updates the display, accepts input, progresses the story further, updates player attributes, etc.  It's worth noting that Python wasn't even around at that time, and so I really only knew C++ and did everything with it.  I still use it, so there's nothing to worry about regarding my C++ understanding.

### TensorFlow

The certification is important.  It proves that I'm familiar and handy with TensorFlow _itself_, and is an officially-backed degree, you could say.

Aside from that, you should have a custom project that you use tensorflow with.

### OpenCV

### Actual deep learning knowledge and computer vision

tensorflow-without-a-phd.  This repository is officially supported by TensorFlow, and is highly valuable towards understanding and practicing convolutional neural networks, dropouts, time series analysis, and the like.  So this repository is a solid point why you folks should consider my candidacy.

The official certification covers a variety of subjects, but I can tell you that they are broadly categorized into 3: CNNs, natural language processing, and time series analysis.  This job of course has nothing to do with natural language, but the other 2 subjects are important for computer vision and deep learning, and so that's good for my candidacy for this role.  This is another big point regarding my candidacy.

The other big point regarding my candidacy is my application of computer vision to my particular problem domain: Super Smash Bros.

These 3 things taken together, combined with the classic chicken-and-the-egg problem, means you folks should hire me.
