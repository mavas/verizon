# Candidate work for Verizon computer vision C++ job

This repository contains work just to help convince www.Verizon.com to hire me for a contract job they have open.

- Verizon-created computer vision programming challenge [here](work/challenge/).
- Example computer vision pipeline demonstration [here](work/verizon/).
- Verizon-specific writeup (the rest of this page..)

## C++

It seems like this is heavily C++ oriented, and that's the first language I started with at the age of 15 in middle school.  [Olimar's Escape](https://github.com/mavas/olimar-escape) is the first significant project I worked on.  Of course it featured the obvious game loop that every game has, which updates the display, accepts input, progresses the story further, updates player attributes, etc.  It's worth noting that Python wasn't even around at that time, and so I really only knew C++ and did everything with it.  I still use it, so there's nothing to worry about regarding my C++ understanding.

## OpenCV

The Verizon-provided coding challenge is OpenCV-specific (no TF).  Aside from that, I've read the book from www.PyImageSearch.com, compiled the software specifically for Python language bindings, am familiar with its haar cascacedes work, and the cvkit library.

## TensorFlow

The certification is significant.  It proves that I'm familiar and handy with TensorFlow _itself_, and is an officially-backed degree, you could say.

Aside from the official certification though, you should have a custom project that you use tensorflow with, and this is (one of) mine.  They involve 1.) convolutional neural networks for image classification, 2.) incorporation of Tensorboard statistics and visualization, 3.) an Apache Beam pipeline that incorporates and _combines_ both OpenCV and TF model results (for increased performance/accuracy), and 4.) custom-made and published datasets.

## Relavent knowledge and understanding

- [tensorflow-without-a-phd](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/tensorflow-without-a-phd).  This repository is officially supported by TensorFlow, and is valuable towards understanding and practicing convolutional neural networks, dropouts, time series analysis, and the like.  So this repository is a solid point why you folks should consider my candidacy.

- [The official certification](https//www.tensorflow.org/certificate) covers a variety of subjects, but I can tell you that they are broadly categorized into 3: convolutional neural networks (CNNs), natural language processing, and time series analysis.  The job of course looks like it doesn't have much to do with NLP, but the other 2 subjects are important/significant, and so that's good for my candidacy for this role.
